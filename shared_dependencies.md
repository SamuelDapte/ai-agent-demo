The shared dependencies between the files we are generating include:

1. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of dependencies and scripts for the Next.js application. All other files indirectly depend on this as it manages the packages used across the application.

2. **tsconfig.json**: This file contains the configuration for TypeScript. It is used across all TypeScript files (.tsx) in the project.

3. **.next/config.js**: This file contains the configuration for the Next.js application. It is used across all pages and components in the project.

4. **pages/index.tsx, pages/_app.tsx, pages/_document.tsx**: These files share common Next.js functions and components such as `getInitialProps`, `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, and `getStaticPaths`. They also share common React components and hooks such as `React`, `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`.

5. **components/Header.tsx, components/Footer.tsx**: These files share common React components and hooks such as `React`, `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`. They also share common CSS modules from the styles directory.

6. **styles/globals.css, styles/Home.module.css**: These files share common CSS properties and selectors. They are used across all pages and components in the project.

7. **public/favicon.ico, public/vercel.svg**: These files are used across all pages in the project. They are referenced in the `_document.tsx` file.

8. **Function Names**: Functions such as `getInitialProps`, `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, and `getStaticPaths` are shared across the pages. React hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext` are shared across the components.

9. **Exported Variables**: Variables exported from one module may be used in another. For example, components exported from `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` may be used in page files.

10. **DOM Element IDs**: IDs of DOM elements are shared across files if JavaScript functions or CSS styles need to reference them.

11. **Message Names**: If the application uses a messaging system (like events or Redux actions), the names of these messages would be shared across files that dispatch or listen for these messages.
